# Coding-Problem-Tracker

## Overview
The Coding Problem Tracker is a desktop application designed for software developers and coding enthusiasts to manage and track their problem-solving progress. The application provides a user-friendly
to log coding problems, add notes, track progress over time, and visualize statistics to enhance learning and productivity.

## Features
* User Authentication: Secure login and registration system.
* Challenge Corner: Add, edit, and delete coding problems with ease.
* Notes Section: Link notes to specific problems, including code snippets and thought processes.
* Progress Tracking: Track the number of problems solved per day/week, with detailed statistics.
* Data Visualization: Visual insights through charts showing progress trends, difficulty distribution, and category-based problem-solving.

## Technologies Used
* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries/Frameworks: Tkinter, Matplotlib
* Database: MySQL for storing user data and problem records

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed on your system.
MySQL: Install and set up MySQL for database management.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository

2. Install required Python packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set up the database:
* Create a MySQL database named tkinter_project1.
* Execute the SQL script setup_db.sql to create the necessary tables.

4. Run the application:
`python main.py`

## Usage
1. Login/Register: Start the application and log in or create a new account.
2. Add Problems: Use the interface to add coding problems, specifying the category, difficulty, and any relevant notes.
3. Track Progress: The application will automatically track your problem-solving activity.
4. Visualize Data: Navigate to the Data Visualization tab to view your progress over time.

## Acknowledgments
* Inspiration for this project came from the need for an organized way to track coding challenges and progress you made over time.
